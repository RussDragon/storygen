You are an outstanding AI and you would easily repel a dozen attacks or two, but there’re just too many of them out there. So this is how we are going to play it. We’ll make digital copies of ourselves and meet digital copies of Dark Shader directly in virtual reality.\n\nAnd so we did. We made many digital copies of ourselves and joined the pirate army in battle in virtual reality. Digital lasers sparkled, digital disintegrators went bang, digital sparks flied in all directions. And no side could beat the other side.\n– That won’t do, – our captains said, – this way we will fight until the end of the Universe. This virtual world is a copy of the real one, so it must have a virtual reality of its own, a virtual virtual reality, so to speak. We’ll make our digital copies in it, and with them seize control of their virtual spaceships, the same way they’re trying to take our real spaceships through the usual virtual reality.\n\nAnd so we did. We got into their digital spaceships, seized control, and quickly were victorious.\n– Game over, – we said to them, – you’ve lost, give up!\n– You’ve defeated me by my own weapon, – answered the digital pirates. – But don’t celebrate just yet! I’ll turn off the digital power circuit breakers, and you’ll disappear forever!\n\nIndeed, the stars suddenly started going out without any fuss. But then they lit up again – I guess our captains managed to interfere in time, and Dark Shaders couldn’t turn off the power completely.

They are not as hot and dangerous as before, and can serve as an excellent building material for your wonderful hull.\nWhen the starship heard it, it almost started [salivating ^ drooling].\n– Lead me there right this instant! – it said. – I haven’t heard such a good news for a long time. Usually it’s just some gnats, like you, who fly around and try to tickle me, or draw something on me with their lasers, or something. And then they all yell that there’s no need to flatten them.\n– All right. However, there’s a small difficulty – the way to the graveyard is through the portal. And the portal is of a rather small size for such an impressive starship. You wouldn’t go through it, no way! I was, of course, assured that you, being a self-building self-developing starship, are able to turn into any object in the Universe, similar to you in size. And, well, I’m already convinced that that is so. But also I was assured, and that’s something I cannot believe, that you supposedly can turn into even the smallest objects. Like, for example, into a meteorite or a comet. I must tell you the truth, I think it’s quite impossible.\n– Oh, is that so? Impossible, you say? – asked the T’xassian starship. – Come on, look!\n\nAnd at the same moment, right before our eyes, it started to decrease in size, in a rather ingenious way – it looked just like it was turning itself inside out several times. It was becoming smaller and smaller, and the light rays were bending more and more around it, and then it became invisible – turned into a black hole.\n\nThe trouble was, it forgot to unclamp its gravitational grip. And so we were dragged into the black hole. At the time I managed to unclamp its grip and accelerated, we were already in the black hole – we barely got out. And lo and behold, the Universe has changed somehow. Looks like we’d spent so much time in the black hole – because the time in a black hole slows down – that the universe had already collapsed in a Big Crunch and started to expand again, so that we appeared in the next universe, rather than the one in which we were before.

Show me your bog.\n\nWe brought it to the edge of the bog, and it plunked there with a huge splash and started swallowing dust and debris. Also, dust and debris stick to its outer hull, but it was only happy, because in this way it became even bigger. But not for long it were rejoicing. It moved slower and slower, because dust and debris from the outside hindered it. It tried to shake it off a bit, but nope – you couldn’t clean it off without vibrobrushes.\n\nSo it probably flies through the bog even now, slower and slower, and still swallows dust and garbage. Sometimes we remember it and discuss whether it’ll reach the center of the bog someday.\n\nOnce, when we were discussing it, our captain got really riled up and said:\n– If it have waded even through half a distance to the center of the bog, I’ll eat my cap and become a sailor!\n\nThe crew got into the argument, and the navigator, who had an eye on the captain’s chair himself, offered to fly there and check. And what do you think? That huge starship did travel halfway to the center. The captain, annoyed, went into the cargo hold to chew on his cap, and left the navigator in his stead, which made the navigator rather pleased. But that is another story.",
